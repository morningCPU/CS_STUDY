ONE Based on G++
+   g++ -g <1> -o <2>   
    //Contines debugging information
    <1> The address of the file to be compiled
    <2> The location where the compiled file placed
    ! Cannot be placed under a folder that does not exist
+   Debugging      
    Steps:
        1. click debugging
        2. click creat launch.json file
        3. choose C++ (GDB/LLDB)
        4. choose Start with GDB 

TWO Based on Cmake
+   used to generate a makefile file
+   Steps:
    1. newly built CMakeLists.txt //Note that the name should be the same
    2. ctrl + shift + p then select the cmake configutation
        You can see that a build file is sutomatically created
    3. enter the terminal
    4. go to the build folder
    5. enter cmake ..
    6. enter mingw32-make.exe
    7. you can see that a .exe file is created in the build folder
+   debugging   
    reconfigure launch.json file
    for example : "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/newfile.exe",

THREE   Precautions
+   in launch.json,change "externalConsole": flase to "externalConsole": true
    The program will run on a new page
+   The main function is followed by system("pause");
    Otherwise,the progream will simply exit
